- clone the forked repo using the ssh or https links:

  - ssh: `git@github.com:username/team-helsinki-react.git`
  - https: `https://github.com/username/team-helsinki-react.git`

- create a new branch that is based on `main` using the command `git checkout -b branch-name`
- the branch-name should be descriptive and wording should depend on whether you are working on a feature, chore, or bug. Refer to the project readme [here](https://github.com/redxzeta/Awesome-Adoption/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch naming tips
- run `npm i` to install `node-modules` and all project dependencies
- `yarn start` to run the app locally
